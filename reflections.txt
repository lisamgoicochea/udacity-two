Sense of direction when it comes to boxifying projects is a skill that has been strengthened since the beginning of this project.

This project was pretty easy :)

Getting my project to upload and view correctly was difficult! Ended up creating a new repo and pushing updated file.

Not giving up especially when errors are minor and can easily be solved!
